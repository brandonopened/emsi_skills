# emsi_skills
python file to retrieve credentials and files; slightly modified from the EMSI api documentation; maybe I did 
something wrong from their example but this worked for me. 

I am not affiliated at all with EMSI, just wanted to use the API to browse the skills etc.

Go to https://skills.emsidata.com/ to signup etc and API documentation is here:
